# Past Assignments
There are two folders here: clean and Master. Clean has the assignments cleaned from what I'd done previously. Master is what I'd done before


## Assignments 1-4
Just do the .ipynb files, simple as

## Assignment 5
Read the README in the folder, follow instructions found there. If in doubt, check the master

## Assignment 6
Since I don't have the original, I wasn't really able to clean it well. It's just there for show, and hasn't been cleaned properly.

### Important final note:
I am unsure how much of the master is objectively correct. If there are any inconsistencies between the master and the style guide, just assume that I was wrong, and that the guide is correct. If there are any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
