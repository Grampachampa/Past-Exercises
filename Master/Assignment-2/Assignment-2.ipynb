It is situated in the north of Marvdasht city and at a distance of 57 km from Shiraz in Fars province. This building is known as the ceremonial capital of the [Achaemenid Empire](https://www.worldhistory.org/Achaemenid_Empire/) (c. 550–330 BC), and it is a unique masterpiece that exemplifies the Achaemenid style of architecture. \n",

    "The plan of this complex was laid during the reign of Darius the Great - 515 BC - and its construction and completion were continued by Xerxes (son of Darius) and Ardashir I (his grandson). The palaces of Persepolis have been very diverse. Persepolis has about fifteen large palaces and halls with royal architecture, all of which were magnificent and had columned halls.\n",

    "Other tools used for pulling with ropes were well wheels or winches. These tools were invented almost at the same time as composite spools. Winches are of two types: (1) with a horizontal axis like a normal well wheel (horizontal winch) and (2) with a vertical axis like an extraction wheel (vertical winch). The mechanical advantage of both of these devices is described based on the ratio of the length of the handles to the radius of the axis. Thus, the mechanical advantage of a horizontal winch, for example, with a handle length of 60 cm and a shaft radius of 15 cm is 4 to 1, and the mechanical advantage of a vertical winch with a handle length of 100 cm and a radius of 20 cm is 5 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historians combine and have a crane consist of a triple composite spool system (with mechanical advantage 3) with a horizontal winch (with mechanical advantage 4) and a vertical winch (with mechanical advantage 5). One worker provides 50 kg in force except with decorated columns in which case they need to be careful and only supply 30 kg in force. Historians would like to know how much load can be carried in different situations.\n",
