Borges was an outstanding Argentinian writer who wrote about time, space, destiny, and reality. \"The Library of Babel\" is one of his most famous short stories. In this story, Borges presents an idea of a universe represented as a library that contains all possible books, written in all possible languages build atop 25 symbols that include: 22 lower-case letters of the alphabet, the comma, the period, and the space. We encourage you to read the whole story (you can find the PDF version [here](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf)). It is not needed for this assignment, but it might give you a different perspective about life. Give it a try! And if you still want to explore more, we invite you to visit the [virtual library](https://libraryofbabel.info/) created by Jonathan Basile.\n",
